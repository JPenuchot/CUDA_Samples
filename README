REQUIREMENTS :

	- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010/Visual C++ 2012 (Visual C++ 2010 is free on Microsoft website) or better
	- CUDA enabled device (See list of CUDA devices on Nvidia website)
	- CUDA drivers (Get them on Nvidia website)
	- CUDA GPU Computing SDK (Also on Nvidia website)
	- Brain.

INSTALLATION :

	Well, I guess you can open a project and press F7 after you installed all the tools/SDK needed.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX :

												|| CUDApi ||

	CUDApi is program that computes an approx value of  Pi using an algorithm similar  to  Monte-Carlo  algorithm
	distributed on the GPU.  The algorithm is scalable but not dinamically scaled. It is a good way to understand
	how GPU computing works  (Allocation, multi-threading). I recommend you using the profiler to have an idea of
	the optimization level.

												|| CPUpi ||

	CPUpi is exactly the  same program than CUDApi  but  as  a linear algorithm and running on the CPU instead of
	the GPU. It could be simplified and optimized but  it wouldn't be the same algorithm than  its GPGPU version.

												|| CPUref & CUDAtests ||

	These are some projects to make some tests. You  can use  them  to  make your own programs.  CUDAtests is
	already configured so you can easily make your CUDA project without any problem.
